# git workflows sandbox

This Git Workflows Sandbox is used, in concert with other materials, to train contributors to open source projects. 
While it was originally designed to teach Git best practices for contributors to Clear Linux* OS, our support for other open source projects has grown.
Note: This training is intended to be given in person/via Skype and is accompanied by presentation slides. 

To request a training, send an email to the repo maintainer.

 This training teaches how to:

* Use git commands
* Fork, clone, and add an upstream of https://github.com/clearlinux/clear-linux-documentation
* Add remotes and create branches
* Apply Clear Linux\*Â OS rules of collaboration for contributors and reviewers

*Note: Files contained herein are not official Clear Linux* OS documentation.*
