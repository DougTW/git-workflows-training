# git-workflows-training

This Git Workflows Sandbox is used to train contributors to Clear Linux\* OS documentation. It's also used 
to train other contributors to open source projects. I'm happy to set up a training session. 
Note: This training is accompanied by other slides and is intended to be given in person/via Skype.  

To request a training, send an email to the repo maintainer.

 This training teaches how to:

* Use git commands
* Fork, clone, and add an upstream of https://github.com/clearlinux/clear-linux-documentation
* Add remotes and create branches
* Apply Clear Linux\*Â OS rules of collaboration for contributors and reviewers

*Note: Files contained herein are not official Clear Linux* OS documentation.*
