# git workflows sandbox

This Git Workflows Sandbox is used, in concert with other materials, to train contributors to open source projects. 
While it was originally designed to teach Git best practices for contributors to Clear Linux* OS, our support for other open source projects has grown.
Note: This training is intended to be given in person/via Skype and is accompanied by presentation slides. 

To request a training, send an email to the repo maintainer.

 This training teaches how to:

* Use git commands
* Fork, clone, and add remotes
* Create branches for development
* Submit a Pull Request

Use this sandbox as practice in preparation for contributing to [Clear Linux Documentation](https://github.com/clearlinux/clear-linux-documentation)

*Note: Files contained herein are not official Clear Linux* OS documentation.*
