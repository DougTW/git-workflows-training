# git-workflows-training

I use this Git Workflows Sandbox to train contributors to Clear Linux\* OS documentation. I also use 
this repo to train folks on other open source projects, and I'm happy to set up a training session. 
Note: This training is accompanied by other slides and is intended to be given in person/via Skype..  

To request a training, please [send an email](michael.vincerra@intel.com).

 This training teaches you how to:

* Use git commands
* Fork, clone, and add an upstream of https://github.com/clearlinux/clear-linux-documentation
* Add remotes and create branches
* Apply Clear Linux\*Â OS rules of collaboration for contributors and reviewers

*Note:The files contained herein are not official Clear Linux documentation.*
